# GrpcClientNuget


## `Background`

This is a POC - *Proof Of Concept* - born from the need of having a package of all the code need for the set up of a GRPC client.

Since when working with grpc in a MicroServices environment theres the need to keep up with all the protofile generated and all the clients need to make in between MicroServices GRPC communication, I took the nuget approach to simplify this maintenance.

My plan is to build a nuget with every method for all rpc calls that a single proto file supports. 

**With this I can simply add this nugget file to any Service and make it communicate with another without the need to rewrite the grpc client code over and over again**.


## `Future plans` 

Since this is a simple POC there's still much to be done.
 - Implementing out of the box Health checks to the grpc server,
 - Adding some logging and observability which can be done on the main Service or in the nuget.


## `TO DO`
 - Clean up Docker files generated by Visual Studio and add nuget config to project restore stage.
 - Create Github actions for nuget deploy on push or merge to Master/Develop
 - Create Nuget auto-versioning


 # `Important`

 This project was made with .Net 6 and Visual Studio 2022 Preview and since it is still in is development stages a bug where the HotReload Feature ws generating errors while the GrpcServer was returning the Reply.

 To solve this error simply deactivate Css HotReaload Feature in VS.
